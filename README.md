# WEBD-EXAM
#Art Gallery project
In this project, I have created an art gallery website of my own.
The features that I have added in it are:
Images of artworks.
Their name and descriptions.
Their discounted and original prices
A link to their external website.
A section on how to make your own art gallery
A table comparing the different artworks in my art gallery.

To achieve this, I have used my html knowledge.
The tags
