    <h2>Romantic Oil Painting artwork</h2>
    <p>
        <em>This is a stunningly vibrant and expressive painting that captures a <strong>romantic, dreamlike</strong>
            scene of a couple
            walking down a lamp-lit avenue. <br> The artwork is defined by its explosive use of color and a highly
            textured,
            energetic application of paint, likely using a palette knife.</em>

    <h2>Tree Artwork</h2>
    <p>
        <em>This artwork presents a <strong>magnificent and powerful tree</strong>, captured with an incredible sense of
            energy and
            emotion. <br>

            The style is abstract and highly textured, with thick, bold strokes of paint that suggest the use of a
            palette knife. This technique gives the entire piece a dynamic, sculptural quality. <br>

            The tree itself is a stunning study in contrast. The left side bursts forth in an explosion of life, with
            leaves painted in fiery reds, brilliant yellows, and vivid greens against a bright, hopeful turquoise sky.
            It feels full of vitality and growth.</em>

    <h2>The Great Wave of Kanagawa</h2>
    <p>
        <em>This is one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable works in the history of art: "The Great Wave off
            Kanagawa," by the <strong>Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai</strong>. <br>

            The composition is dominated by an immense, towering wave that seems poised to crash down. Its crest curls
            into menacing, claw-like tendrils of foam, creating a moment of incredible tension and raw power. Caught in
            the turbulent sea below are three vulnerable boats filled with fishermen, who appear helpless against the
            overwhelming force of nature.</em>

    <h2>Romantic Oil Painting artwork</h2>
    <p>
        <em>This is a deeply romantic and vibrant painting that captures an <strong>intimate moment between a couple on
                a rainy
                night. </strong> <br>

            The central focus is a couple walking away from the viewer, sheltered together under a single umbrella. They
            stroll along a lamp-lit path that runs beside a body of water. The artist uses a highly expressive, textured
            technique, likely with a palette knife, applying thick layers of paint to create a sense of energy and
            dimension.</em>

    <h2>Steps to create your own art gallery.</h2><!--Steps section-->
    <ol type="1"><!--Steps to make your own art gallery-->
        <li value="1">Define Your Vision and Niche: First, decide on the core identity of your gallery. Determine what
            kind of art
            you will specialize inâ€”such as contemporary paintings, sculpture, photography, or works by local emerging
            artists. A clear focus will help you attract a specific audience of artists and collectors and establish a
            unique brand for your gallery.</li>
        <li>Create a Solid Business Plan and Secure Funding: Treat your gallery like a business from day one. Write a
            detailed plan that outlines your mission, budget, and financial projections. This should include costs for
            securing and renovating a physical space, marketing expenses, insurance, and staff salaries. Research
            different funding options, whether it's personal savings, small business loans, or finding investors who
            believe in your vision.</li>
        <li>Curate Artists and Plan Exhibitions: The art and artists you represent are the heart of your gallery.
            Actively seek out artists whose work aligns with your gallery's niche by visiting art fairs, degree shows,
            and artist studios. Build strong, professional relationships with them and develop a dynamic exhibition
            schedule for your first year to generate excitement and keep visitors coming back.</li>
        <li>Focus on Marketing and Community Building: Getting people through the door is crucial. Create a professional
            website and active social media profiles to showcase your artists and upcoming shows. Plan engaging opening
            night receptions and other events like artist talks or workshops to build a community around your space.
            Network with local press, art critics, and potential collectors to establish your gallery's presence and
            reputation.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul><!--Materials and techniques section-->
        <li>Palette Knife Application: The artist likely used a palette knife instead of a brush to apply the paint,
            creating sharp edges and flat, textured areas.</li>
        <li>Impasto Technique: Thick, visible layers of paint (impasto) are used to give the artwork a distinct
            sculptural and three-dimensional quality.</li>
        <li>Vibrant Oil or Acrylic Paints: The rich colors and heavy texture are characteristic of either oil or acrylic
            paints applied generously on a canvas.</li>
        <li>Expressive Color Blocking: Bold sections of contrasting warm (reds/oranges) and cool (blues) colors are
            placed side-by-side to create dramatic mood and light.</li>
